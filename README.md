# Skills-Sync

`skills-sync` is a Windows-first CLI for syncing local `skills` folders across multiple AI apps.

## What it does

- Scans local AI app skill directories
- Imports skills into a shared master folder
- Creates Windows Junction links for supported apps
- Optionally syncs the master folder to GitHub
- Checks link health and repairs broken targets

## Install

```bash
npm i -g skills-sync
```

## Quick Start

```bash
skills-sync
```

On first run, the CLI will guide you through setup.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `skills-sync` | Interactive startup flow |
| `skills-sync setup` | Create `config.yaml` and master folder |
| `skills-sync init` | Run setup, import, and link in one step |
| `skills-sync import` | Scan and import local skills into master |
| `skills-sync link` | Create or repair Junction links |
| `skills-sync health` | Check link status and Git state |
| `skills-sync sync` | Commit and push changes to GitHub |
| `skills-sync watch` | Watch the master folder and sync on change |
| `skills-sync rollback` | Roll back to a previous commit |
| `skills-sync clone [repo]` | Clone a remote skills repo |
| `skills-sync app` | Manage configured apps |
| `skills-sync list` | List discovered local skills |

## Supported Apps

The default config includes common Windows paths for:

- Claude Code
- Antigravity
- Gemini CLI
- Codex

You can edit `config.yaml` later to add or disable apps.

## GitHub Workflow

If you want to keep the master skills folder in GitHub:

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub.
2. Run `skills-sync setup` and provide the repo URL when prompted.
3. Use `skills-sync sync` to push later updates.

## Local Config

The app writes `config.yaml` in the project root. That file is intentionally ignored from version control because it contains your personal paths.

Example:

```yaml
masterDir: C:/Users/USERNAME/AISkills

git:
  enabled: true
  remote: https://github.com/your-name/skills-sync.git
  autoPush: true

apps:
  - name: Claude Code
    skillsPath: C:/Users/USERNAME/.claude/skills
    enabled: true
```

## Platform Notes

- Windows is the primary target.
- Junction links are used so admin rights are usually not required.
- Node.js 18+ is required.

## Publishing Notes

This repo is ready to be published as a standalone GitHub project and, if you want, as an npm package later.
